The TinyFPGA Card is my business card.  It's also an FPGA project board that can be assembled with an 8 x 8  array of LEDs, 8 buttons, a coin cell, and a TinyFPGA [A1](https://store.tinyfpga.com/products/tinyfpga-a1) or [A2](https://store.tinyfpga.com/products/tinyfpga-a2) board.

### Components

All of the necessary components are located in the [TinyFPGA Card BOM](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/1BQzpLEW) on octopart.com.  They should all be in stock at Mouser.com as well.
